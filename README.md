# Knock-Pattern-Recognizer
Recognizes a programmed knock pattern at varying tempos.

For some reason, even though the input pin is set to A10, it works with A9.

The touch sensor is connected to +5V, Gnd and analog pin A9. The NC pin is ignored.

The arduino prints instructions through the serial com.
